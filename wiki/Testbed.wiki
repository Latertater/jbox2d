= Introduction =

So getting physics right can be tough, and bugs with physics can often take a while to discover.  So it's always a good idea to create a physics prototype of the behavior you want before you build your application or game around it.  The testbed is the perfect place to to this, as it provides:
 * run loop
 * simple graphics
 * expandable settings
 * easy input support
 * serialization (saving/loading)
so you can get down to the hairy details of getting your physics correct instead of worrying about other things going wrong.

= Testbed UI =

Lets start by taking a look at testbed user interface.

|| *UI Element* || *Description* ||
|| Test Selection ||This list contains the tests (and categories) in the testbed.  Clicking on one of these will exit the current test and enter the selected one.  Clicking on a category will start the first test in that category. ||
|| Engine Options || This panel contains options that modifies the way the engine behaves internally. ||
|| Testbed Options || These are options to modify the way the testbed or current test behaves. ||
|| Controls || These buttons are pretty self-explanatory, and save/load are only enabled if the test support serialization. ||
|| Reporting Area ||  This area is for any text from the testbed or test. ||
