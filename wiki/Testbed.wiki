So getting physics right can be tough, and bugs with physics can often take a while to discover.  So it's always a good idea to create a physics prototype of the behavior you want before you build your application or game around it.  The Testbed is the perfect place to to this, as it provides

* run loop
* simple graphics
* expandable settings
* easy input support
* serialization (saving/loading)

so you can get down to the hairy details of getting your physics correct instead of worrying about other things going wrong.
